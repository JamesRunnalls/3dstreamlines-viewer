# Dynamic Lakes

## Description

Dynamic lakes displays simulated mixing in Lake Geneva from Jan 4th.

## Online

See the site at www.dynamiclakes.com

## How it works

A 3D array of flow velocity information is downloaded from the server, this is then used to generate streamflows which can be plotted used threejs. 

## Data Source

Data comes from the
[Meteolakes](http://meteolakes.ch/) project.

The meteolakes project uses Delft3D to simulate realtime and forcasted lake conditions (temperature & flow velocity) using meteorological conditions from MeteoSwiss and river conditions from BAFU.
